## Introduction
This project is aimed for me to practice building a 2D platform game with the Python arcade library.
I do not own the code myself. All materials and code are from the Real Python [
Arcade Platformer article](https://realpython.com/platformer-python-arcade/).
 
>There is still plenty to do with this video game. Some more features can be implemented such as
adding a game-over screen, adding a victory green and many more! More game levels can also be added
as the game progresses. You will need [Tiled](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled), tiled map editor,
 to build your own game level.
